# Youtube Video Summary Generation

Generate a summary for a youtube video with OPEN AI REST API.

The purpose of creating this program is to learn Open AI API, but also to help me watch videos on Youtube more efficiently.

1. First, create a .env file in the current directory.

    ```Env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR OPENAI API KEY]
    ```

1. Execute the following command in your command line tool. e.g. 

    ```CLI
    python gs.py --url="http://y2u.be/49gDWE9pB5k"
    ```

1. Once everything works, you should see the screenshot below.
